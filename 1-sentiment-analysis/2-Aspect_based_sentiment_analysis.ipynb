Lots of head retention that is nice and frothy. Lots of lacing is left behind. S- Such a wonderful tangerine smell, with copious amount of honey that make this smell so sweet. Lastly you smell a light malt smell that goes great with the honey. You can barely smell any hops here, as some pine barely makes it through. T- Initial light bitter, piney hops, that turns right into a sweet malt flavor that dominates my palate. I love malty beers so I may be biased. Tastes of honey biscuit, tangerine, and light grapefruit just come together to make a very solid beer. S- Light body and light carbonation makes this beer go down fast. O- I know hops are the craze nowadays, but this is my go to APA. This beer goes back to the basics with light amounts of hops and a nice sweet taste that goes down great.  \n",

This one seems a little weird and it caught my eye, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz Nitro bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label is awesome and it goes great with this beer, it's very eye catching. It poured a bright red color that took on more of redish pink hue when held to the light with a fingers worth of slightly creamy off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with a weird beet aroma being the first to show up and that goes into the malts which impart a pretty grainy, pale malt and bread aromas. Up next comes some fruity aromas with no noticeable chocolate. This beer has a nice aroma, it's unique, but I don't think the beets help it. T- The taste seems to be a little similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of medium sweetness with the malts being the first to show up and they impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the breadyness sticking out the most and it goes into the beets which show up a little less than they did in the aroma, but they still impart the same weird and earthy aspects. Up next comes an English ale yeast like flavor and on the finish there's a lighter amount of medium bitterness with a linger beat flavor. This is a decent tasting beer, but I don't feel like the flavors work that well together and it doesn't live up to it's name. M- Fairly smooth, pretty creamy, a little on the flat side, on thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is nice and it worked well with this beer, but I don't think the nitro really helped it. Overall I thought this beer was ok and I thought it was pretty much just an average example of the style and it's hard to pin point what style it is because it's not very oatmeal stout like at all and it doesn't really remind of red velvet cake. THis beer doesn't have good drinkability, one is more than enough for me. What I like the most about this beer is the appearance and aroma, those are the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer is the taste and drinkability, they just aren't that good and they need some. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I might turn one down, I can't say I would recommend, if your want a beer that tastes like red velvet cake I think you will be disappointed. All in all wasn't a big fan of this beer and I think it just needs to be reworked from the ground up. It's one of my least favorite blast point beers and it's not a great example of the style. Better luck next time guys, this one could use some work.  \n",
      "[2025-04-30 16:20:03] (2.4.1.post1) Example 0: I picked up a Nitro bottle of Ballast Point's Red Velvet for $2.39 at The Lager Mill. This one seems a little weird and it caught my eye, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz Nitro bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label is awesome and it goes great with this beer, it's very eye catching. It poured a bright red color that took on more of redish pink hue when held to the light with a fingers worth of slightly creamy off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with a weird beet aroma being the first to show up and that goes into the malts which impart a pretty grainy, pale malt and bread aromas.

Massive dense head is poured, pretty requisite to style. Aroma is pretty mute: whiffs of roasted grain, some creamy milk chocolate, a bit of floral hops, and finally some bitter black patent. On the palate, it is a luxurious smoothness of a light Irish stout, very dry with the creamy chocolate flavors coming first, a little astringency in the mid palate and finishing with a long sustain of black patent bitterness. Mouthfeel is spot on, low carbonation, medium body with a nicely textured head. Overall, these are the stouts for summer drinking.

The flavour has a fine balance - moderate bitterness with plenty of bready malt. Apple, chocolate, and toffee all make contributions as well.

A beer from Baltika which doesnt have a number! One of the great things about living in LA is the multi-cultural atmosphere I work in, my work colleagues know my love for beer and often I get unexpected gifts from some obscure places, this is one of them from a fellow Engineer formerly of Russia. A metric sized half-litre (500ml) brown glass bottle, labeled as 1 Pint 0.9 fluid ounces for the US market. The label is all foreign to me though, none of this translated Arsenalnoye rubbish, my bottle has the word APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE which translates as Beer from the Arsenal, in rough speak above the words Extra Lager in a smaller white text. The Arsenal heritage is borne out by the symbol atop the main label, a pair of dueling flintlock pistols crossed over a large letter A in a red circle. Main crown cap is red and has the text APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE &#1055;&#1054;&#1042;&#1054;. Listed as Alc. 7.0% by Vol. with a Production Date of 03.08.05 and Best before Date of 03.08.06. Appearance: Tremendous head on the pour, an expansive white jobby which stays at around 1-2 for some time and only slowly collapses, but always leaves a decent covering. Faded golden body with a pale-straw super-lucid clarity. A handful of streamers with average carbonation levels. Soft lacing which soon slides down back into the body of the Lager. Nose: Low strength aromas, I struggled to get anything at first, but I managed to get a reasonable guess at what was going on before the beer completely disappeared. Taste: Biscuit malts, pale and lightly toasted with some sweetness and a little grassy bitterness in the finish. Very middle of the road, it never strays from the tried-and-tested Lager formula, but there again neither does it suffer the awful adjunct laden sweet corn soaked in high alcohol crappy tastes that many East-Euro 5%+ Lagers project. Clean enough to enjoy but simple enough to forget. Mouthfeel: Never found the alleged 7% alcohol, unless it was asleep and waiting to kick my ass later on. Conditioning was good enough to add a smooth aspect and the lightly chilled body which kept the tastes in check. It felt OK, nothing great but good enough. Drinkability: I must stay that I really did not mind this one, not mediocre but nothing more than average. Simple enough with a clean profile, and I certainly wouldnt turn this one away at a Russian BBQ if it were offered. Overall: Not that bad actually, rather surprised in fact. But still just OK.  \n",

This beer smells fruity with a higher than average alcohol content of 8.3%. The beer is a dark amber color when poured into a bottle with a heavy amount of white lacing. Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel.

Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel. The taste is slightly sweet due to the Belgian yeast but neither that nor the taste of the hops linger. This is a very drinkable beer.\n"

Man this brings back memories. I used to drink this all the time a few years back (out of the bottle no less) before I moved on to better things. Pours like a standard ale. Nothing out of the ordinary. Yellow, as you can see in the photo above. Minimal head that quickly and completely disappears, never to be seen again. There's little to no head retention which is always a little disappointing. I am picking up very little in the aroma, not much but a hint of malt and grains and...um. Fruit? Some kind of fruit I guess. The taste is actually better than I was expecting. I guess there was a reason I drank this so much back then. A fairly okay amount malt with an inoffensive barely bitter finish, with an overall lemony fruitness to it. Nice sticky yet refreshing mouthfeel. I don't think this beer is aspiring to be anything but a well brewed crowd pleaser and if that is the case it does its job well. This wouldn't be a bad beer at all to session or slake your thirst or drink when your attention was focused elsewhere. I'd probably prefer something with a bit more character than this myself, but you could do a lot worse. I think this would be a great beer to keep in your fridge to offer guests who are used to macros.  \n",

There is a 1/4“ light tan head that recedes to a ring and an irregular island of foam on the surface. Sipping creates a few scattered specks and patches of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aromas include the chocolate and raspberry blend up front, with just a hint of roasted malt in the background. The flavors are much as expected from the nose with but with chocolate up front and backed up strongly by the raspberries. There’s also a light touch of roasted malt and bitterness from the roast. Mingled in to the flavor mix are some fruity sweetness and a bit of tartness from the raspberries. There doesn’t seem to be any real hop bitterness showing. The alcohol is well concealed here and noticeable only from the slight warmth it creates after several sips. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and fairly smooth with the small bubbled light carbonation. The medium long finish begins as the chocolate and roasted malt recede further into the background, leaving the raspberry, the light sweetness and the touch of tartness to slowly follow them. Finally in the ending there is again some dark roasted bitterness that becomes tinged with a dry hint of the raspberry in the back of the palate. Overall this is a very well made beer that I’m very much enjoying and one I certainly expect to be having again. In fact I think I’ll get another bottle to have on hand for a special occasion or for a day that needs to be improved by having a special beer. If you think you might enjoy chocolate covered raspberries this is recommended.  \n",

The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and very nice lacing. At least for this bottle, the nose is the best part of this beer, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, light skunky weed, some noticable pine and white pepper. The flavor profile replicates the nose to some extent, but there is already some noticeable sweet maltiness in the mid palate and finish that I associate with less than optimal freshness in this beer. Otherwise, this IPA is on the dry side, with a moderately long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean, moderately bitter finish. A couple of thoughts about this beer. I used to see this beer on tap frequently at various bars in Pittsburgh when I lived in Morgantown. While always pretty good, I was also always a bit hesitant to order it, as in my experience this beer goes down hill pretty quickly once it's been tapped. Fresh, this beer was a tasty IPA that I would frequently order as an alternative to Bells Two Hearted, which was the other staple I'd see on tap in and around Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I ordered far too many pints of HH that were nowhere close to optimal freshness, which is why I became increasingly cautious about ordering it. On the other hand, a bottle sent to me by a friend a few months back was incredible, and at long last I could see some basis for the lofty score this beer seems to routinely get on BA. The one I drank last night was decent, but in light of the bottle I enjoyed a few months back, something of a disappointment. Bottle/batch variation seems to be the order of the day with this beer, which is the only cautionary note I would make regarding this otherwise well made IPA from Fat Head's.  \n",

      "[2025-04-30 16:20:10] (2.4.1.post1) Warning: reference sentiment does not exist or its number 0 is not equal to aspect number 1, text:  [B-ASP]Global Sentiment[E-ASP]    12 oz. bottle with just a plain and simple dark forest green label that has the name of the beer in big white letters. To the left side is a description of the beer and why it's called \"Saint Bridget's Porter.\" Below that is where they say this beer got the gold at the World Beer Cup all the way back in 1996. To the right side is where they keep the US Government warning, refund values, address of the brewery, and a notched month and week bottle date. Mine was hard to see where they notched it, so I don't know how this beer was. Appearance: When poured into a Bell's brewery pint glass, this Porter is a dark cola mahagony brown with a less than a 1/2 inch head of tan foam. The head of foam quickly fizzled away in a matter of only 2 seconds. It manage to leave behind islands of fizzy bubbles, tan foamy rings, and a smidge of tan rings around the glass. Smell: It had a nice medium sized base aroma of roasted espresso beans. Once I got passed the espresso cloud, I got a big whiff of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, and a pinch of sweet caramel and roasted hops. Taste: I could taste all the characteristics of a good Porter in the making. It had all the usual Porter tastes of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and a splash of roasted hops. But what made this one so different was the fact that it tasted like Great Divide watered down most of the roasted flavors for some odd reason. It was fine where the taste was going, but then it did a U-turn when the water kicked in. Mouthfeel: I thought it was a heavly carbonated medium bodied beer that had a quick aftertaste of roasted espresso beans, dark chocolate, and dark roasted malts. It's too bad the aftertaste didn't last long because there were quite a few good flavors in that aftertaste. Drinkability: It was an OK porter from Great Divide, but it could have been a great Porter from Great Divide if they hadn't watered down the taste. In the world of Porters, I could pass on this one.  \n",

The head creates a rocky surface as it slowly subsides, all the while leaving a nice lacing pattern on the sides of the glass. The aroma is nicely hop focused with notes of spicy herbs, and a full, rich grapefruit citrus character. The citrus is the single most noticeable aspect of the aroma, with maybe just a hint of malt character coming through as well. Hop fruit aromatics of apricot, peaches and some sort of sweet tropical fruit are also noticeable in the nose. A sharp, spicy taste of hops greets my tongue as I first take a sip. Immediately though the citrus character becomes the dominant note; it leans towards sweet citrus fruit like oranges, tangelos, grapefruit and even some smooth tropical fruit notes. The carbonation is fairly low, which makes this very smooth to drink; almost creamy in texture. Caramelized malt notes, a touch of brown sugar, and some light toasted grain character play a supporting role for the dominant hop character. A nice bitterness is here as well, though it is not overly powering; it plays as a nice juxtaposition to the softer, more approachable fruity hop character. This is just a nice easy drinking Pale Ale, I could easily drink a couple pints of this brew. It is so well balanced to be quaffed pint by pint. Perhaps I could wish for a bit more chewy malt body here, but that would keep it from being so drinkable. I am a sucker for the fruity, smooth hop varieties right now (in this case Amarillo) so this Pale Ale is right up my alley.  \n",

Doesn’t smell especially piney or citrusey, but good. T (4.25) – This beer tastes pretty good. Not super malty, and not much spice going on.

Mouthfeel is good bodied, carbonation was a bit on the higher side, and a finish that is bitter a little dry and lingers. Enjoyable, but definitely not my favorite chocolate oatmeal stout.\n"

Pours thickly veiled brown with yellow-tan highlights -- almost like the inside of an overripe plum. Modest head dissipates to a fine surface film. Smells of prune, plum, banana, a little bit of cherry-tinged funk. Comes together to smell a bit like unsweetened purple grape juice. The smell is a true harbinger of the taste: deep plum and light caramel flavors form the backbone as banana and subtle cherry tart notes take turns. The light tartness builds a bit and ends up being the last note at the finish line. Lots of subtle complexity here for the style: no one flavor dominates or speaks out of turn. Very drinkable in that you can keep discovering new flavors over multiple servings. A real standout in the Belgian brown class.  \n",

This one seems a little weird and it caught my eye, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz Nitro bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label is awesome and it goes great with this beer, it's very eye catching. It poured a bright red color that took on more of redish pink hue when held to the light with a fingers worth of slightly creamy off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with a weird beet aroma being the first to show up and that goes into the malts which impart a pretty grainy, pale malt and bread aromas. Up next comes some fruity aromas with no noticeable chocolate. This beer has a nice aroma, it's unique, but I don't think the beets help it. T- The taste seems to be a little similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of medium sweetness with the malts being the first to show up and they impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the breadyness sticking out the most and it goes into the beets which show up a little less than they did in the aroma, but they still impart the same weird and earthy aspects. Up next comes an English ale yeast like flavor and on the finish there's a lighter amount of medium bitterness with a linger beat flavor. This is a decent tasting beer, but I don't feel like the flavors work that well together and it doesn't live up to it's name. M- Fairly smooth, pretty creamy, a little on the flat side, on thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is nice and it worked well with this beer, but I don't think the nitro really helped it. Overall I thought this beer was ok and I thought it was pretty much just an average example of the style and it's hard to pin point what style it is because it's not very oatmeal stout like at all and it doesn't really remind of red velvet cake. THis beer doesn't have good drinkability, one is more than enough for me. What I like the most about this beer is the appearance and aroma, those are the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer is the taste and drinkability, they just aren't that good and they need some. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I might turn one down, I can't say I would recommend, if your want a beer that tastes like red velvet cake I think you will be disappointed. All in all wasn't a big fan of this beer and I think it just needs to be reworked from the ground up. It's one of my least favorite blast point beers and it's not a great example of the style. Better luck next time guys, this one could use some work.  \n",

It was a bargain. The cork popped loud and far despite my gentle opening. The cork was stamped with \"SB 10\". The first pour was bright and a clear rich golden color. Cloudier on subsequent pours. The brittle white head sizzled down fairly fast leaving only a film created by the nucleation of the glass. Smell was pretty bold. Pear and Pixie Stix candy. Public toilet dampness faded from the aroma. This one cleaned up and hints of pepper arose. Interesting. Taste was tart and fruity. Champagne-like. Wood notes. Bone dry. Delicious but not especially complex. It doesn't seem to change and unfold like some superior Gueuzes. I could drink this any day and be thrilled! Mouthfeel was prickly with a medium body. Finishes a bit deflated. Overall, very good!  \n",

The cork popped loud and far despite my gentle opening. The cork was stamped with \"SB 10\". The first pour was bright and a clear rich golden color. Cloudier on subsequent pours. The brittle white head sizzled down fairly fast leaving only a film created by the nucleation of the glass. Smell was pretty bold. Pear and Pixie Stix candy. Public toilet dampness faded from the aroma. This one cleaned up and hints of pepper arose. Interesting. Taste was tart and fruity. Champagne-like. Wood notes. Bone dry. Delicious but not especially complex. It doesn't seem to change and unfold like some superior Gueuzes. I could drink this any day and be thrilled! Mouthfeel was prickly with a medium body. Finishes a bit deflated. Overall, very good!\n"

On the palate, it is a luxurious smoothness of a light Irish stout, very dry with the creamy chocolate flavors coming first, a little astringency in the mid palate and finishing with a long sustain of black patent bitterness.

The flavour has a fine balance - moderate bitterness with plenty of bready malt. Apple, chocolate, and toffee all make contributions as well. The finish has a tootsie roll character and fruit lingers beyond that. No alcohol was apparent. Full bodied with low carbonation and an extremely smooth texture. Truly awesome.

A beer from Baltika which doesnt have a number! One of the great things about living in LA is the multi-cultural atmosphere I work in, my work colleagues know my love for beer and often I get unexpected gifts from some obscure places, this is one of them from a fellow Engineer formerly of Russia. A metric sized half-litre (500ml) brown glass bottle, labeled as 1 Pint 0.9 fluid ounces for the US market. The label is all foreign to me though, none of this translated Arsenalnoye rubbish, my bottle has the word APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE which translates as Beer from the Arsenal, in rough speak above the words Extra Lager in a smaller white text. The Arsenal heritage is borne out by the symbol atop the main label, a pair of dueling flintlock pistols crossed over a large letter A in a red circle. Main crown cap is red and has the text APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE &#1055;&#1054;&#1042;&#1054;. Listed as Alc. 7.0% by Vol. with a Production Date of 03.08.05 and Best before Date of 03.08.06. Appearance: Tremendous head on the pour, an expansive white jobby which stays at around 1-2 for some time and only slowly collapses, but always leaves a decent covering. Faded golden body with a pale-straw super-lucid clarity. A handful of streamers with average carbonation levels. Soft lacing which soon slides down back into the body of the Lager. Nose: Low strength aromas, I struggled to get anything at first, but I managed to get a reasonable guess at what was going on before the beer completely disappeared. Taste: Biscuit malts, pale and lightly toasted with some sweetness and a little grassy bitterness in the finish. Very middle of the road, it never strays from the tried-and-tested Lager formula, but there again neither does it suffer the awful adjunct laden sweet corn soaked in high alcohol crappy tastes that many East-Euro 5%+ Lagers project. Clean enough to enjoy but simple enough to forget. Mouthfeel: Never found the alleged 7% alcohol, unless it was asleep and waiting to kick my ass later on. Conditioning was good enough to add a smooth aspect and the lightly chilled body which kept the tastes in check. It felt OK, nothing great but good enough. Drinkability: I must stay that I really did not mind this one, not mediocre but nothing more than average. Simple enough with a clean profile, and I certainly wouldnt turn this one away at a Russian BBQ if it were offered. Overall: Not that bad actually, rather surprised in fact. But still just OK.  \n",

As you can see by the amount of review this beer has been amazing successful and is the most popular out of all FLying Dog brews. It satisfies the needs of the hop heads out there and also caters to those on the opposite end of the spectrum that like the Belgian. This beer smells fruity with a higher than average alcohol content of 8.3%. The beer is a dark amber color when poured into a bottle with a heavy amount of white lacing. Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel. The taste is slightly sweet due to the Belgian yeast but neither that nor the taste of the hops linger. This is a very drinkable beer.  \n",

Man this brings back memories. I used to drink this all the time a few years back (out of the bottle no less) before I moved on to better things. Pours like a standard ale. Nothing out of the ordinary. Yellow, as you can see in the photo above. Minimal head that quickly and completely disappears, never to be seen again. There's little to no head retention which is always a little disappointing. I am picking up very little in the aroma, not much but a hint of malt and grains and...um. Fruit? Some kind of fruit I guess. The taste is actually better than I was expecting. I guess there was a reason I drank this so much back then. A fairly okay amount malt with an inoffensive barely bitter finish, with an overall lemony fruitness to it. Nice sticky yet refreshing mouthfeel. I don't think this beer is aspiring to be anything but a well brewed crowd pleaser and if that is the case it does its job well. This wouldn't be a bad beer at all to session or slake your thirst or drink when your attention was focused elsewhere. I'd probably prefer something with a bit more character than this myself, but you could do a lot worse. I think this would be a great beer to keep in your fridge to offer guests who are used to macros.  \n",

There is a 1/4“ light tan head that recedes to a ring and an irregular island of foam on the surface. Sipping creates a few scattered specks and patches of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aromas include the chocolate and raspberry blend up front, with just a hint of roasted malt in the background. The flavors are much as expected from the nose with but with chocolate up front and backed up strongly by the raspberries. There’s also a light touch of roasted malt and bitterness from the roast. Mingled in to the flavor mix are some fruity sweetness and a bit of tartness from the raspberries. There doesn’t seem to be any real hop bitterness showing. The alcohol is well concealed here and noticeable only from the slight warmth it creates after several sips. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and fairly smooth with the small bubbled light carbonation. The medium long finish begins as the chocolate and roasted malt recede further into the background, leaving the raspberry, the light sweetness and the touch of tartness to slowly follow them. Finally in the ending there is again some dark roasted bitterness that becomes tinged with a dry hint of the raspberry in the back of the palate. Overall this is a very well made beer that I’m very much enjoying and one I certainly expect to be having again. In fact I think I’ll get another bottle to have on hand for a special occasion or for a day that needs to be improved by having a special beer. If you think you might enjoy chocolate covered raspberries this is recommended.  \n",

The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and very nice lacing. At least for this bottle, the nose is the best part of this beer, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, light skunky weed, some noticable pine and white pepper. The flavor profile replicates the nose to some extent, but there is already some noticeable sweet maltiness in the mid palate and finish that I associate with less than optimal freshness in this beer. Otherwise, this IPA is on the dry side, with a moderately long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean, moderately bitter finish. A couple of thoughts about this beer. I used to see this beer on tap frequently at various bars in Pittsburgh when I lived in Morgantown. While always pretty good, I was also always a bit hesitant to order it, as in my experience this beer goes down hill pretty quickly once it's been tapped. Fresh, this beer was a tasty IPA that I would frequently order as an alternative to Bells Two Hearted, which was the other staple I'd see on tap in and around Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I ordered far too many pints of HH that were nowhere close to optimal freshness, which is why I became increasingly cautious about ordering it. On the other hand, a bottle sent to me by a friend a few months back was incredible, and at long last I could see some basis for the lofty score this beer seems to routinely get on BA. The one I drank last night was decent, but in light of the bottle I enjoyed a few months back, something of a disappointment. Bottle/batch variation seems to be the order of the day with this beer, which is the only cautionary note I would make regarding this otherwise well made IPA from Fat Head's.  \n",

The flavor was also grain forward with a bit of a hop tang on the finish. The body was surprisingly full, not heavy and a bit too sweet to be called crisp, and very enjoyable.

Poured a nice medium golden yellow with a thin cap of white head that had OK retention and lacing. The was nicely grainy, with a solid, but mellow, dose of hops. The flavor was also grain forward with a bit of a hop tang on the finish. The body was surprisingly full, not heavy and a bit too sweet to be called crisp, and very enjoyable.

To the left side is a description of the beer and why it's called \"Saint Bridget's Porter.\" Below that is where they say this beer got the gold at the World Beer Cup all the way back in 1996. To the right side is where they keep the US Government warning, refund values, address of the brewery, and a notched month and week bottle date. Mine was hard to see where they notched it, so I don't know how this beer was. Appearance: When poured into a Bell's brewery pint glass, this Porter is a dark cola mahagony brown with a less than a 1/2 inch head of tan foam. The head of foam quickly fizzled away in a matter of only 2 seconds. It manage to leave behind islands of fizzy bubbles, tan foamy rings, and a smidge of tan rings around the glass. Smell: It had a nice medium sized base aroma of roasted espresso beans. Once I got passed the espresso cloud, I got a big whiff of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, and a pinch of sweet caramel and roasted hops. Taste: I could taste all the characteristics of a good Porter in the making. It had all the usual Porter tastes of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and a splash of roasted hops. But what made this one so different was the fact that it tasted like Great Divide watered down most of the roasted flavors for some odd reason. It was fine where the taste was going, but then it did a U-turn when the water kicked in. Mouthfeel: I thought it was a heavly carbonated medium bodied beer that had a quick aftertaste of roasted espresso beans, dark chocolate, and dark roasted malts. It's too bad the aftertaste didn't last long because there were quite a few good flavors in that aftertaste. Drinkability: It was an OK porter from Great Divide, but it could have been a great Porter from Great Divide if they hadn't watered down the taste. In the world of Porters, I could pass on this one.  \n",

The head creates a rocky surface as it slowly subsides, all the while leaving a nice lacing pattern on the sides of the glass. The aroma is nicely hop focused with notes of spicy herbs, and a full, rich grapefruit citrus character. The citrus is the single most noticeable aspect of the aroma, with maybe just a hint of malt character coming through as well. Hop fruit aromatics of apricot, peaches and some sort of sweet tropical fruit are also noticeable in the nose. A sharp, spicy taste of hops greets my tongue as I first take a sip. Immediately though the citrus character becomes the dominant note; it leans towards sweet citrus fruit like oranges, tangelos, grapefruit and even some smooth tropical fruit notes. The carbonation is fairly low, which makes this very smooth to drink; almost creamy in texture. Caramelized malt notes, a touch of brown sugar, and some light toasted grain character play a supporting role for the dominant hop character. A nice bitterness is here as well, though it is not overly powering; it plays as a nice juxtaposition to the softer, more approachable fruity hop character. This is just a nice easy drinking Pale Ale, I could easily drink a couple pints of this brew. It is so well balanced to be quaffed pint by pint. Perhaps I could wish for a bit more chewy malt body here, but that would keep it from being so drinkable. I am a sucker for the fruity, smooth hop varieties right now (in this case Amarillo) so this Pale Ale is right up my alley.  \n",

This one seems a little weird and it caught my eye, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz Nitro bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label is awesome and it goes great with this beer, it's very eye catching. It poured a bright red color that took on more of redish pink hue when held to the light with a fingers worth of slightly creamy off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with a weird beet aroma being the first to show up and that goes into the malts which impart a pretty grainy, pale malt and bread aromas. Up next comes some fruity aromas with no noticeable chocolate. This beer has a nice aroma, it's unique, but I don't think the beets help it. T- The taste seems to be a little similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of medium sweetness with the malts being the first to show up and they impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the breadyness sticking out the most and it goes into the beets which show up a little less than they did in the aroma, but they still impart the same weird and earthy aspects. Up next comes an English ale yeast like flavor and on the finish there's a lighter amount of medium bitterness with a linger beat flavor. This is a decent tasting beer, but I don't feel like the flavors work that well together and it doesn't live up to it's name. M- Fairly smooth, pretty creamy, a little on the flat side, on thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is nice and it worked well with this beer, but I don't think the nitro really helped it. Overall I thought this beer was ok and I thought it was pretty much just an average example of the style and it's hard to pin point what style it is because it's not very oatmeal stout like at all and it doesn't really remind of red velvet cake. THis beer doesn't have good drinkability, one is more than enough for me. What I like the most about this beer is the appearance and aroma, those are the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer is the taste and drinkability, they just aren't that good and they need some. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I might turn one down, I can't say I would recommend, if your want a beer that tastes like red velvet cake I think you will be disappointed. All in all wasn't a big fan of this beer and I think it just needs to be reworked from the ground up. It's one of my least favorite blast point beers and it's not a great example of the style. Better luck next time guys, this one could use some work.  \n",

Aroma is of earthy and crisp citrus hops with a little sweet bread in the back. The flavor is the same as above really. Just a hint of soft bitterness. The sweet bread comes through a little more in the flavor but the hops shine through to brighten things up a little. Very smooth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp and smooth.

Dated \"15- sept 1999\". I purchased this beer @ UTObeer in the Borough Market in London while there in 2007. The label is in Flemish I believe. I paid 9.00 pounds for this one ($18+ at the time). It was a bargain. The cork popped loud and far despite my gentle opening. The cork was stamped with \"SB 10\". The first pour was bright and a clear rich golden color. Cloudier on subsequent pours. The brittle white head sizzled down fairly fast leaving only a film created by the nucleation of the glass. Smell was pretty bold. Pear and Pixie Stix candy. Public toilet dampness faded from the aroma. This one cleaned up and hints of pepper arose. Interesting. Taste was tart and fruity. Champagne-like. Wood notes. Bone dry. Delicious but not especially complex. It doesn't seem to change and unfold like some superior Gueuzes. I could drink this any day and be thrilled! Mouthfeel was prickly with a medium body. Finishes a bit deflated. Overall, very good!  \n",

Massive dense head is poured, pretty requisite to style. Aroma is pretty mute: whiffs of roasted grain, some creamy milk chocolate, a bit of floral hops, and finally some bitter black patent. On the palate, it is a luxurious smoothness of a light Irish stout, very dry with the creamy chocolate flavors coming first, a little astringency in the mid palate and finishing with a long sustain of black patent bitterness. Mouthfeel is spot on, low carbonation, medium body with a nicely textured head. Overall, these are the stouts for summer drinking.

A beer from Baltika which doesnt have a number! One of the great things about living in LA is the multi-cultural atmosphere I work in, my work colleagues know my love for beer and often I get unexpected gifts from some obscure places, this is one of them from a fellow Engineer formerly of Russia. A metric sized half-litre (500ml) brown glass bottle, labeled as 1 Pint 0.9 fluid ounces for the US market. The label is all foreign to me though, none of this translated Arsenalnoye rubbish, my bottle has the word APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE which translates as Beer from the Arsenal, in rough speak above the words Extra Lager in a smaller white text. The Arsenal heritage is borne out by the symbol atop the main label, a pair of dueling flintlock pistols crossed over a large letter A in a red circle. Main crown cap is red and has the text APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE &#1055;&#1054;&#1042;&#1054;. Listed as Alc. 7.0% by Vol. with a Production Date of 03.08.05 and Best before Date of 03.08.06. Appearance: Tremendous head on the pour, an expansive white jobby which stays at around 1-2 for some time and only slowly collapses, but always leaves a decent covering. Faded golden body with a pale-straw super-lucid clarity. A handful of streamers with average carbonation levels. Soft lacing which soon slides down back into the body of the Lager. Nose: Low strength aromas, I struggled to get anything at first, but I managed to get a reasonable guess at what was going on before the beer completely disappeared. Taste: Biscuit malts, pale and lightly toasted with some sweetness and a little grassy bitterness in the finish. Very middle of the road, it never strays from the tried-and-tested Lager formula, but there again neither does it suffer the awful adjunct laden sweet corn soaked in high alcohol crappy tastes that many East-Euro 5%+ Lagers project. Clean enough to enjoy but simple enough to forget. Mouthfeel: Never found the alleged 7% alcohol, unless it was asleep and waiting to kick my ass later on. Conditioning was good enough to add a smooth aspect and the lightly chilled body which kept the tastes in check. It felt OK, nothing great but good enough. Drinkability: I must stay that I really did not mind this one, not mediocre but nothing more than average. Simple enough with a clean profile, and I certainly wouldnt turn this one away at a Russian BBQ if it were offered. Overall: Not that bad actually, rather surprised in fact. But still just OK.  \n",

This beer smells fruity with a higher than average alcohol content of 8.3%. The beer is a dark amber color when poured into a bottle with a heavy amount of white lacing. Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel.

Man this brings back memories. I used to drink this all the time a few years back (out of the bottle no less) before I moved on to better things. Pours like a standard ale. Nothing out of the ordinary. Yellow, as you can see in the photo above. Minimal head that quickly and completely disappears, never to be seen again. There's little to no head retention which is always a little disappointing. I am picking up very little in the aroma, not much but a hint of malt and grains and...um. Fruit? Some kind of fruit I guess. The taste is actually better than I was expecting. I guess there was a reason I drank this so much back then. A fairly okay amount malt with an inoffensive barely bitter finish, with an overall lemony fruitness to it. Nice sticky yet refreshing mouthfeel. I don't think this beer is aspiring to be anything but a well brewed crowd pleaser and if that is the case it does its job well. This wouldn't be a bad beer at all to session or slake your thirst or drink when your attention was focused elsewhere. I'd probably prefer something with a bit more character than this myself, but you could do a lot worse. I think this would be a great beer to keep in your fridge to offer guests who are used to macros.  \n",

There is a 1/4“ light tan head that recedes to a ring and an irregular island of foam on the surface. Sipping creates a few scattered specks and patches of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aromas include the chocolate and raspberry blend up front, with just a hint of roasted malt in the background. The flavors are much as expected from the nose with but with chocolate up front and backed up strongly by the raspberries. There’s also a light touch of roasted malt and bitterness from the roast. Mingled in to the flavor mix are some fruity sweetness and a bit of tartness from the raspberries. There doesn’t seem to be any real hop bitterness showing. The alcohol is well concealed here and noticeable only from the slight warmth it creates after several sips. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and fairly smooth with the small bubbled light carbonation. The medium long finish begins as the chocolate and roasted malt recede further into the background, leaving the raspberry, the light sweetness and the touch of tartness to slowly follow them. Finally in the ending there is again some dark roasted bitterness that becomes tinged with a dry hint of the raspberry in the back of the palate. Overall this is a very well made beer that I’m very much enjoying and one I certainly expect to be having again. In fact I think I’ll get another bottle to have on hand for a special occasion or for a day that needs to be improved by having a special beer. If you think you might enjoy chocolate covered raspberries this is recommended.  \n",

The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and very nice lacing. At least for this bottle, the nose is the best part of this beer, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, light skunky weed, some noticable pine and white pepper. The flavor profile replicates the nose to some extent, but there is already some noticeable sweet maltiness in the mid palate and finish that I associate with less than optimal freshness in this beer. Otherwise, this IPA is on the dry side, with a moderately long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean, moderately bitter finish. A couple of thoughts about this beer. I used to see this beer on tap frequently at various bars in Pittsburgh when I lived in Morgantown. While always pretty good, I was also always a bit hesitant to order it, as in my experience this beer goes down hill pretty quickly once it's been tapped. Fresh, this beer was a tasty IPA that I would frequently order as an alternative to Bells Two Hearted, which was the other staple I'd see on tap in and around Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I ordered far too many pints of HH that were nowhere close to optimal freshness, which is why I became increasingly cautious about ordering it. On the other hand, a bottle sent to me by a friend a few months back was incredible, and at long last I could see some basis for the lofty score this beer seems to routinely get on BA. The one I drank last night was decent, but in light of the bottle I enjoyed a few months back, something of a disappointment. Bottle/batch variation seems to be the order of the day with this beer, which is the only cautionary note I would make regarding this otherwise well made IPA from Fat Head's.  \n",

The flavor was also grain forward with a bit of a hop tang on the finish. The body was surprisingly full, not heavy and a bit too sweet to be called crisp, and very enjoyable.

The nose is a near equal mixture of lightly toasted caramel malt and spicy hops; the hops being a bit more prominent. I like the flavor, though it could be more assertive. Malt dominates the start with spicy hops fading in and taking over at the midway point of each mouthful. Malt appears again on the finish due to a minor grain/husk intrusion. There's a mineral-like (though not metallic) aspect to the finish as well. It isn't an overly hoppy beer considering the style.

It could stand to be more flavor assertive, particularly with regard to hops. It's still enjoyable though, and does go down rather easily.  \n",

To the left side is a description of the beer and why it's called \"Saint Bridget's Porter.\" Below that is where they say this beer got the gold at the World Beer Cup all the way back in 1996. To the right side is where they keep the US Government warning, refund values, address of the brewery, and a notched month and week bottle date. Mine was hard to see where they notched it, so I don't know how this beer was. Appearance: When poured into a Bell's brewery pint glass, this Porter is a dark cola mahagony brown with a less than a 1/2 inch head of tan foam. The head of foam quickly fizzled away in a matter of only 2 seconds. It manage to leave behind islands of fizzy bubbles, tan foamy rings, and a smidge of tan rings around the glass. Smell: It had a nice medium sized base aroma of roasted espresso beans. Once I got passed the espresso cloud, I got a big whiff of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, and a pinch of sweet caramel and roasted hops. Taste: I could taste all the characteristics of a good Porter in the making. It had all the usual Porter tastes of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and a splash of roasted hops. But what made this one so different was the fact that it tasted like Great Divide watered down most of the roasted flavors for some odd reason. It was fine where the taste was going, but then it did a U-turn when the water kicked in. Mouthfeel: I thought it was a heavly carbonated medium bodied beer that had a quick aftertaste of roasted espresso beans, dark chocolate, and dark roasted malts. It's too bad the aftertaste didn't last long because there were quite a few good flavors in that aftertaste. Drinkability: It was an OK porter from Great Divide, but it could have been a great Porter from Great Divide if they hadn't watered down the taste. In the world of Porters, I could pass on this one.  \n",

A: Dense opaque black with a soft cap of khaki tan head. S: Intense bourbon and whiskey notes without being extraordinarily boozy...rye whiskey spice as well? Tons and tons of rich sweet milk chocolate, toasted almond, and oak. T: Taste follows the nose with just a bit more booze; bourbon, oak, rich dark chocolate fudge...toasted coconut and almond, strong notes of whiskey accompanies a touch of burn on the throat, with hints of spiced vanilla.

I do give them some credit for a uniqueness of it, actually getting pumpkin into a lambic without it really sucking at least. I'm glad I only paid a few bucks to try this on draft rather than a handful of money for a big bottle that I don't think I could finish by myself. The single glass is hard enough to finish.  \n",

The head creates a rocky surface as it slowly subsides, all the while leaving a nice lacing pattern on the sides of the glass. The aroma is nicely hop focused with notes of spicy herbs, and a full, rich grapefruit citrus character. The citrus is the single most noticeable aspect of the aroma, with maybe just a hint of malt character coming through as well. Hop fruit aromatics of apricot, peaches and some sort of sweet tropical fruit are also noticeable in the nose. A sharp, spicy taste of hops greets my tongue as I first take a sip. Immediately though the citrus character becomes the dominant note; it leans towards sweet citrus fruit like oranges, tangelos, grapefruit and even some smooth tropical fruit notes. The carbonation is fairly low, which makes this very smooth to drink; almost creamy in texture. Caramelized malt notes, a touch of brown sugar, and some light toasted grain character play a supporting role for the dominant hop character. A nice bitterness is here as well, though it is not overly powering; it plays as a nice juxtaposition to the softer, more approachable fruity hop character. This is just a nice easy drinking Pale Ale, I could easily drink a couple pints of this brew. It is so well balanced to be quaffed pint by pint. Perhaps I could wish for a bit more chewy malt body here, but that would keep it from being so drinkable. I am a sucker for the fruity, smooth hop varieties right now (in this case Amarillo) so this Pale Ale is right up my alley.  \n",

The smell is a true harbinger of the taste: deep plum and light caramel flavors form the backbone as banana and subtle cherry tart notes take turns.

S - Strong aroma of dank hops, pine, and tropical fruit. Some malt odor comes through as well, hopefully setting the stage for something good in the first sip. Smells like a good west coast imperial IPA should. T - Core is definitely West coast IPA flavor: mango, and grapefruit. A good bit of resinous pine. Fantastic sweet maui onion and garlic in the mid-palate. Biscuity malt provides a nice base and a hint of sweetness. The malt/hop balance is there and the complex hop bill is there.

That description doesn't encompass the drinkability here...it all comes together nearly perfectly so much so that I had to force myself to sip instead of gulp. O - Outstanding and just well put together on all levels. The vegetal onion/garlic notes really set this one apart from some of it's competition and border on divine to this taster. Why am I not drinking more Green Flash brews? A \"quick rebuy\", meaning I'll probably run out and get another bottle as soon as possible.  \n",

This one seems a little weird and it caught my eye, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz Nitro bottle into a imperial pint glass. A- The label is awesome and it goes great with this beer, it's very eye catching. It poured a bright red color that took on more of redish pink hue when held to the light with a fingers worth of slightly creamy off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with a weird beet aroma being the first to show up and that goes into the malts which impart a pretty grainy, pale malt and bread aromas. Up next comes some fruity aromas with no noticeable chocolate. This beer has a nice aroma, it's unique, but I don't think the beets help it. T- The taste seems to be a little similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of medium sweetness with the malts being the first to show up and they impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the breadyness sticking out the most and it goes into the beets which show up a little less than they did in the aroma, but they still impart the same weird and earthy aspects. Up next comes an English ale yeast like flavor and on the finish there's a lighter amount of medium bitterness with a linger beat flavor. This is a decent tasting beer, but I don't feel like the flavors work that well together and it doesn't live up to it's name. M- Fairly smooth, pretty creamy, a little on the flat side, on thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is nice and it worked well with this beer, but I don't think the nitro really helped it. Overall I thought this beer was ok and I thought it was pretty much just an average example of the style and it's hard to pin point what style it is because it's not very oatmeal stout like at all and it doesn't really remind of red velvet cake. THis beer doesn't have good drinkability, one is more than enough for me. What I like the most about this beer is the appearance and aroma, those are the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer is the taste and drinkability, they just aren't that good and they need some. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I might turn one down, I can't say I would recommend, if your want a beer that tastes like red velvet cake I think you will be disappointed. All in all wasn't a big fan of this beer and I think it just needs to be reworked from the ground up. It's one of my least favorite blast point beers and it's not a great example of the style. Better luck next time guys, this one could use some work.  \n",

A beer from Baltika which doesnt have a number! One of the great things about living in LA is the multi-cultural atmosphere I work in, my work colleagues know my love for beer and often I get unexpected gifts from some obscure places, this is one of them from a fellow Engineer formerly of Russia. A metric sized half-litre (500ml) brown glass bottle, labeled as 1 Pint 0.9 fluid ounces for the US market. The label is all foreign to me though, none of this translated Arsenalnoye rubbish, my bottle has the word APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE which translates as Beer from the Arsenal, in rough speak above the words Extra Lager in a smaller white text. The Arsenal heritage is borne out by the symbol atop the main label, a pair of dueling flintlock pistols crossed over a large letter A in a red circle. Main crown cap is red and has the text APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE &#1055;&#1054;&#1042;&#1054;. Listed as Alc. 7.0% by Vol. with a Production Date of 03.08.05 and Best before Date of 03.08.06. Appearance: Tremendous head on the pour, an expansive white jobby which stays at around 1-2 for some time and only slowly collapses, but always leaves a decent covering. Faded golden body with a pale-straw super-lucid clarity. A handful of streamers with average carbonation levels. Soft lacing which soon slides down back into the body of the Lager. Nose: Low strength aromas, I struggled to get anything at first, but I managed to get a reasonable guess at what was going on before the beer completely disappeared. Taste: Biscuit malts, pale and lightly toasted with some sweetness and a little grassy bitterness in the finish. Very middle of the road, it never strays from the tried-and-tested Lager formula, but there again neither does it suffer the awful adjunct laden sweet corn soaked in high alcohol crappy tastes that many East-Euro 5%+ Lagers project. Clean enough to enjoy but simple enough to forget. Mouthfeel: Never found the alleged 7% alcohol, unless it was asleep and waiting to kick my ass later on. Conditioning was good enough to add a smooth aspect and the lightly chilled body which kept the tastes in check. It felt OK, nothing great but good enough. Drinkability: I must stay that I really did not mind this one, not mediocre but nothing more than average. Simple enough with a clean profile, and I certainly wouldnt turn this one away at a Russian BBQ if it were offered. Overall: Not that bad actually, rather surprised in fact. But still just OK.  \n",
      "[2025-04-30 16:21:01] (2.4.1.post1) Example 0: Presentation: Bless my little cotton Commie socks. A beer from Baltika which doesnt have a number! One of the great things about living in LA is the multi-cultural atmosphere I work in, my work colleagues know my love for beer and often I get unexpected gifts from some obscure places, this is one of them from a fellow Engineer formerly of Russia. A metric sized half-litre (500ml) brown glass bottle, labeled as 1 Pint 0.9 fluid ounces for the US market. The label is all foreign to me though, none of this translated Arsenalnoye rubbish, my bottle has the word APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE which translates as Beer from the Arsenal, in rough speak above the words Extra Lager in a smaller white text. The Arsenal heritage is borne out by the symbol atop the main label, a pair of dueling flintlock pistols crossed over a large letter A in a red circle. Main crown cap is red and has the text APCEHA&#923;&#1041;HOE &#1055;&#1054;&#1042;&#1054;. Listed as Alc. 7.0% by Vol. with a Production Date of 03.08.05 and Best before Date of 03.08.06. Appearance: Tremendous head on the pour, an expansive white jobby which stays at around 1-2 for some time and only slowly collapses, but always leaves a decent covering. Faded golden body with a pale-straw super-lucid clarity. A handful of streamers with average carbonation levels. Soft lacing which soon slides down back into the body of the Lager. Nose: Low strength aromas, I struggled to get anything at first,\n"

This beer smells fruity with a higher than average alcohol content of 8.3%. The beer is a dark amber color when poured into a bottle with a heavy amount of white lacing. Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel.

Nothing out of the ordinary. Yellow, as you can see in the photo above. Minimal head that quickly and completely disappears, never to be seen again. There's little to no head retention which is always a little disappointing. I am picking up very little in the aroma, not much but a hint of malt and grains and...um. Fruit? Some kind of fruit I guess. The taste is actually better than I was expecting. I guess there was a reason I drank this so much back then. A fairly okay amount malt with an inoffensive barely bitter finish, with an overall lemony fruitness to it. Nice sticky yet refreshing mouthfeel. I don't think this beer is aspiring to be anything but a well brewed crowd pleaser and if that is the case it does its job well. This wouldn't be a bad beer at all to session or slake your thirst or drink when your attention was focused elsewhere. I'd probably prefer something with a bit more character than this myself, but you could do a lot worse.

The enigma hop worked here and it was interesting to pick up the nuances of this hop as it's not widely used.\n"

There is a 1/4“ light tan head that recedes to a ring and an irregular island of foam on the surface. Sipping creates a few scattered specks and patches of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aromas include the chocolate and raspberry blend up front, with just a hint of roasted malt in the background. The flavors are much as expected from the nose with but with chocolate up front and backed up strongly by the raspberries. There’s also a light touch of roasted malt and bitterness from the roast. Mingled in to the flavor mix are some fruity sweetness and a bit of tartness from the raspberries. There doesn’t seem to be any real hop bitterness showing. The alcohol is well concealed here and noticeable only from the slight warmth it creates after several sips. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and fairly smooth with the small bubbled light carbonation. The medium long finish begins as the chocolate and roasted malt recede further into the background, leaving the raspberry, the light sweetness and the touch of tartness to slowly follow them. Finally in the ending there is again some dark roasted bitterness that becomes tinged with a dry hint of the raspberry in the back of the palate. Overall this is a very well made beer that I’m very much enjoying and one I certainly expect to be having again. In fact I think I’ll get another bottle to have on hand for a special occasion or for a day that needs to be improved by having a special beer. If you think you might enjoy chocolate covered raspberries this is recommended.  \n",

The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and very nice lacing. At least for this bottle, the nose is the best part of this beer, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, light skunky weed, some noticable pine and white pepper. The flavor profile replicates the nose to some extent, but there is already some noticeable sweet maltiness in the mid palate and finish that I associate with less than optimal freshness in this beer. Otherwise, this IPA is on the dry side, with a moderately long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean, moderately bitter finish. A couple of thoughts about this beer. I used to see this beer on tap frequently at various bars in Pittsburgh when I lived in Morgantown. While always pretty good, I was also always a bit hesitant to order it, as in my experience this beer goes down hill pretty quickly once it's been tapped. Fresh, this beer was a tasty IPA that I would frequently order as an alternative to Bells Two Hearted, which was the other staple I'd see on tap in and around Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I ordered far too many pints of HH that were nowhere close to optimal freshness, which is why I became increasingly cautious about ordering it. On the other hand, a bottle sent to me by a friend a few months back was incredible, and at long last I could see some basis for the lofty score this beer seems to routinely get on BA. The one I drank last night was decent, but in light of the bottle I enjoyed a few months back, something of a disappointment. Bottle/batch variation seems to be the order of the day with this beer, which is the only cautionary note I would make regarding this otherwise well made IPA from Fat Head's.  \n",

To the right side is where they keep the US Government warning, refund values, address of the brewery, and a notched month and week bottle date. Mine was hard to see where they notched it, so I don't know how this beer was. Appearance: When poured into a Bell's brewery pint glass, this Porter is a dark cola mahagony brown with a less than a 1/2 inch head of tan foam. The head of foam quickly fizzled away in a matter of only 2 seconds. It manage to leave behind islands of fizzy bubbles, tan foamy rings, and a smidge of tan rings around the glass. Smell: It had a nice medium sized base aroma of roasted espresso beans. Once I got passed the espresso cloud, I got a big whiff of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, and a pinch of sweet caramel and roasted hops. Taste: I could taste all the characteristics of a good Porter in the making. It had all the usual Porter tastes of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and a splash of roasted hops. But what made this one so different was the fact that it tasted like Great Divide watered down most of the roasted flavors for some odd reason. It was fine where the taste was going, but then it did a U-turn when the water kicked in. Mouthfeel: I thought it was a heavly carbonated medium bodied beer that had a quick aftertaste of roasted espresso beans, dark chocolate, and dark roasted malts. It's too bad the aftertaste didn't last long because there were quite a few good flavors in that aftertaste. Drinkability: It was an OK porter from Great Divide, but it could have been a great Porter from Great Divide if they hadn't watered down the taste. In the world of Porters, I could pass on this one.  \n",

Pours a light brownish amber with a minimal off-white head. Minimal retention and lacing. Smells of toasty and nutty malts with some ripe and overripe citrus.

The head creates a rocky surface as it slowly subsides, all the while leaving a nice lacing pattern on the sides of the glass. The aroma is nicely hop focused with notes of spicy herbs, and a full, rich grapefruit citrus character. The citrus is the single most noticeable aspect of the aroma, with maybe just a hint of malt character coming through as well. Hop fruit aromatics of apricot, peaches and some sort of sweet tropical fruit are also noticeable in the nose. A sharp, spicy taste of hops greets my tongue as I first take a sip. Immediately though the citrus character becomes the dominant note; it leans towards sweet citrus fruit like oranges, tangelos, grapefruit and even some smooth tropical fruit notes. The carbonation is fairly low, which makes this very smooth to drink; almost creamy in texture. Caramelized malt notes, a touch of brown sugar, and some light toasted grain character play a supporting role for the dominant hop character. A nice bitterness is here as well, though it is not overly powering; it plays as a nice juxtaposition to the softer, more approachable fruity hop character. This is just a nice easy drinking Pale Ale, I could easily drink a couple pints of this brew. It is so well balanced to be quaffed pint by pint. Perhaps I could wish for a bit more chewy malt body here, but that would keep it from being so drinkable. I am a sucker for the fruity, smooth hop varieties right now (in this case Amarillo) so this Pale Ale is right up my alley.  \n",

He asked me if I had had a Yellow Rose and when I said \"no\", he twisted my arm a little and I said \"bring it on\", though I doubted it would be as good as he said. Beautiful color and head and a nose that is amazing. The hops flavors explode in my mouth like fireworks. Now THAT is an IPA. Very pine-y but grapefruit as well. Definitely some dank, earthy notes around the edges. Perfect balance, perfect carbonation...this is just about perfection for me.

This beer is basically a staple anywhere you go in SD, thanks mostly to the Tony Gwynn association but even without the local plug, its a pretty fantastic beer.
